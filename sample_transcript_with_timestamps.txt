[00:00] Welcome to this tutorial on adding timestamped transcripts.
[00:15] Timestamps make it easier to navigate through videos.
[00:30] You can format timestamps in several ways.
[00:45] This format uses square brackets at the beginning of each line.
[01:00] You can also use MM:SS format.
[01:15] Or even use HH:MM:SS for longer videos.
[01:30] Timestamps should be consistent throughout the transcript.
[01:45] They can appear at the start of paragraphs.
[02:00] Or even in the middle of text if needed.
[02:15] The system will automatically detect these timestamps.
[02:30] And will always prefer transcripts with timestamps over those without.
[02:45] This helps with better search results and navigation.
[03:00] Thanks for watching this tutorial!
